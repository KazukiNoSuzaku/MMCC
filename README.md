Simulation of a Cellular Mobile Wireless System

The objective of this assignment is to simulate a cellular mobile wireless system. We would be using the help of two fundamental theories from Queueing theories, M/M/C/C, and M1+M2/C/C system, to achieve this task.
M/M/C/C is an M/M/C with a maximum of C cells allowed in the system. For our simulation C=, 16 is the number of servers in the cell tower sim. If the system is full when a cell arrives in the tower range, it is denied entry into the system.

M1+M2/M/C/C system for cell towers has the purpose of taking in new cells as well as old handover ones. It is a priority-based system that prioritizes handover calls over new calls.
Handover: A mobile unit moves out of the range of one cell and into the range of another during a connection. Handover failure is more severe than blocking a new call because it interrupts ongoing conversations or data.
